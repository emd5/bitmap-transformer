# Bitmap-Transformer

Building a bitmap (.bmp) transformer CLI. It will read a bitmap in from disk, run one or more color or raster 
transforms and then write it out to a new file. 

***Example Strategy***
1. Gather user input (infile, outfile, and transform)
2. Read the input bitmap file using the fs module
3. Parse the bitmapâ€™s buffer into object representing a bitmap (using a constructor)
4. Using metadata from the parsed bitmap object run a transform on the buffer directly (mutate the color or raster data)
4. Write the mutated buffer to the output file path
